# Notice
### intended recipient: other developers working on IVDB
these are mostly outdated models/interfaces which parts of the site are possibly dependent on. 
The newer implementation will hopefully require less interfaces (we have simplified the data model a small bit)
So id like to make a point of making the models that version 3 requires, so we can easily delete the unnessecary ones

to distinguish the newer interfaces, I will be appending .model to the file extension like game-info.model.ts
I also think this is kind of conventional anyway. please follow
