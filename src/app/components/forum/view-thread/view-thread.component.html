<!-- possible to have a sub-app-component? like in django?
so that you dont have to repeat the template on each page. -->

<!-- thread should have a forum, that attaches it to the forum- not an attr in forum -->
<!-- get threads by forum.title -->


<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">for each thread in thread.where(forum === this fourm)</li>
</ul>
