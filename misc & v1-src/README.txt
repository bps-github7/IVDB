instructions for "going live" (Note ive never done this, this is just my understanding of how its done):
1) LISCENSE: a web site needs a liscense, the best ones are open source
2) DOMAIN NAME: Need to buy one of those. I think you rent it by the year.
3) SERVER: will need to pay a server to host this content.

the site home page is named 'index.html'
all other content can be access from there.
