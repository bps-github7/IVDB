### TODO for internet videogame db
* rate and review documents should be identified with `gamePK_username`
* flesh out comment section
* get it working across the site. (view-game, review, news, watchlist, etc)
* update all things so that the uid of a document is stored in that document. simplifies all things pertaining to routes and accessing observables.
* create validation to prevent users who do not own a comment from deleting it- only users who have written a comment should have that option/ see the button.
