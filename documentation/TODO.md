# TODO 
items for Internet Video Game Database

### development pointers
- use try catch more often (error handling)
- consider the unlikely situations and prevent them with conditions

### Design / architecture
- draw.io docs in ```documentation``` need revisions for clarity and uptodate accuracy
- add more files here for clarification
- revised requirements list
- bug log 

### NGRX

- testing
- meta reducer
- authentication
- store-router
- keep learning

### Styling
- Responsive (dropdown) navbar
- Use both grid and flexbox in different modules or parent > child components
- Plan out layout in advance- following simple design principles 
  - color
  - spacing
  - font
- Integrate styling with bootstrap and material
- The above point is why im suggesting in general we leave mass styling until finished with component desig (avoid backtracking, conflicted styles).


## Gen Developer Ed. 
- this project was started as a personal project to teach me software developer principles:

### Debugging:
learn better strategies
- use various tools - vsCode, browser (chrome & firefox), redux storeDevtools
- stop throwing stuff at the wall until something sticks

### Testing
need to use this resource . (period)
- unit testing
- integration tests
- test driven development
- linting settings in vscode

### Git & Version Control
In general, a weakness for me, I need to focus on it and learn more to get better
- Be aware of when you are about to make breaking changes
- Employ branches to avoid breakage
- prioritize things by writing and resolve issues.
- **Issues** : give them labels to encourage outside participation.
