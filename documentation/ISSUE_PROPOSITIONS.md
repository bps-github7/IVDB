1. contrib module to shared module 
- suggested by @bps-github7 on 7/5/21

we made a small note in [contributing](./contributing) about thoughts on the future of contributing module. I believe its worth consideration to make contrib a family of components within shared module. this is because many components in contributing will just be helper components within other modules like ```games``` & ```user```

WE havent started implementing this module yet, but thoughts should be put towards how to proceed and consider the above mentioned points- in summary, it probably doesnt need its own feature module and set of sub routes.
