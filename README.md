# IVDB
The Internet Videogame Database is a project to build the most comprehensive online videogame database
Please read the contribution guidelines to learn about the project, before you start working on it.

We are currently in the process of changing the site architecture to use NGRX and Sass.
Due to this, I am in a bit of a productivity lull. I am glad to merge new features from other contributors,
but believe what would be most helpful right now is a dedicated contributor who is well versed in modern ngrx (version 7^) syntax and best practices.

Reach out to me @ bps53@protonmail.com if you would like to be added as a contributor to the firebase project.
this will allow you to make changes to the database and work on other features such as image storage and authentication
